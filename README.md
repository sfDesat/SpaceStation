## Space Station Playtest
I am putting up a tech demo on github. If anybody is interested in testing it here is some information:

### What do you need?
You only need LethalLevelLoader. Please make a fresh profile with only LethalLevelLoader. Then go to `Settings` > `Browse Profile Folde`r. Go to `BepInEx` > `plugins` and make a new folder. Put the files from github into that folder. To download the files from github click on `Code` > `Download ZIP`.

### What is it?
It is just a skybox for now. It includes no gameplay aspects appart from appreciating it, i guess.

### What do I want from you?
Not much, I mainly want to know if you people can run it and if they run into any major issues.
