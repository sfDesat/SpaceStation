## Space Station Playtest
I am putting up a playtest on github. If anybody is interested in testing it here is some information:

### Why?
I am looking to see how far Lethal Company can be pushed and it's looking good.

### What do you need?

You only need LethalLevelLoader. Please make a fresh profile with only LethalLevelLoader. Then go to `Settings` > `Browse Profile Folder`. Go to `BepInEx` > `plugins` and make a new folder. Put the files from github into that folder. To download the files from github click on `Code` > `Download ZIP`.

### What is it?
It is just graphics for now. It includes no gameplay aspects appart from appreciating it, i guess.

### What do I want from you?
Not much, I mainly want to know if you people can run it and if they run into any major issues. Although feedback or ideas are always welcome!

### Known Current Limitations:
- Sun and moon don't move
- Stars don't move
